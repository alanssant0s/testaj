2024-07-24 00:37:07 notice: As of 4.5.0 using query() is deprecated. Instead use `insertQuery()`, `deleteQuery()`, `selectQuery()` or `updateQuery()`.

2024-07-24 01:29:13 notice: 4.4.12 - Having queryString set on exceptions is deprecated.If you are not using this attribute there is no action to take.Otherwise, enable Error.convertStatementToDatabaseException.
/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/aerojuris/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Database/Connection.php, line: 446
You can disable all deprecation warnings by setting `Error.errorLevel` to `E_ALL & ~E_USER_DEPRECATED`. Adding `vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Database/Connection.php` to `Error.ignoredDeprecationPaths` in your `config/app.php` config will mute deprecations from that file only.

You can disable all deprecation warnings by setting `Error.errorLevel` to `E_ALL & ~E_USER_DEPRECATED`. Adding `vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Datasource/Paging/NumericPaginator.php` to `Error.ignoredDeprecationPaths` in your `config/app.php` config will mute deprecations from that file only.
